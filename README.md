The Educational Platform is a web application designed to streamline interactions between students, teachers, and administrators in an educational environment. Built using Python and Streamlit, the platform provides an intuitive interface for managing user roles, posts, comments, grades, and class schedules. The application incorporates a robust SQLite database for handling data efficiently and ensuring the integrity of user information, content, and academic records. Teachers can create posts with file attachments, manage grades, and schedule classes, while students can engage by viewing posts, leaving comments, and accessing their grades with detailed feedback. The platform also includes secure user authentication, role-based access control, and integrated search functionalities for exploring resources on platforms like YouTube, Google, Wikipedia, and Stack Overflow. By combining modern web development tools and efficient database management, the Educational Platform delivers a comprehensive solution for fostering collaboration and learning in an organized and interactive manner.
